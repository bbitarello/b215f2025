I will give specific instructions about this in the assignments but, briefly, for the lab assignments you may search for help on the web, including the LLMs. If you do use LLMs for a lab assignment, you will be required to include citations for each instance where you used it, including the prompt you used. You are also required to cite any other sources of information.\nNote: Stack Overflow and other programming forums online + office hours will be way more helpful to your lasting learning and what you will take from this course than LLMs, by the way. I have never had help from an LLM on a coding error that I could not figure out from online posts in forums.\nFor homework and problem sets: Please don’t use, as there is (ethical) reason to do so. The whole point of these formative assessments is to learn and/or practice for the exams.\nLastly, do remember you won’t be able to use AI or any other external sources beyond one page of your own notes during the midterms.",

Once registered, students should schedule an appointment with the professor as early in the semester as possible to share the verification form and make appropriate arrangements.\n\nPlease reach out as early as possible (ideally, even before classes start) so that we can make the necessary accommodations. Note that accommodations are not retroactive and require advance notice to implement.\nNeed help with math?

However, it is not so. Scientists are flawed and human. The history of science is also a history of who got the credit and is dominated by white, male, colonialist, and racist ideas. I will try to highlight less-known historical figures and provide a critical perspective on such matters whenever possible. I see the diversity of backgrounds and identities our students bring as a strength: age, culture, disability, ethnicity, gender, nationality, religion, sexuality, and socioeconomic status. I intend for this course to serve students from diverse backgrounds and perspectives. Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated. Please let me know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally or for other students or student groups. You can do this in person during office hours, by email, or via the mid-semester anonymous survey.",
