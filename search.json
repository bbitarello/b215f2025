    "text": "But experiments can reveal causation\n\nBecause researchers can randomly assign individuals to treatments, a well-executed experimental study removes confounds (except those that arise by chance!) and allows us to separate cause and effect !!!\n\n\nBut be careful, experimental artifacts can introduce bias.\nFor example, the mental boost of receiving a treatment may help people feel better, an example of the placebo effect – an improvement in medical condition that results form the physychological effects of treatment.\nAppropriate controls are critical to a good experiment.\n\n\n\nPlacebo (Latin): “I shall please”, from placeō, “I please”. Read Interleaf 6 for more on the placebo effect."

    "text": "10.1 Rationale for the LLM/GenAI policy adopted here\nWhile there are many worthy uses of AI (e.g., predicting protein structures based on aminoacid sequences, which has been underway for over a decade), the widespread use of LLMs/GenAI for the most mundane tasks and internet searches has an enormous ecological impact.\nClimate Change\nData centers already consume about 2% of the global electricity output (as of December 20242, likely much more now). These data centers emit enormous amounts of CO2, are mostly powered by non-renewable energy sources – for example, projected growth demands on energy grids to keep up with data center development plans are already delaying the retirement of coal power plants in the U.S.3 – and consume an enormous amount of clean freshwater4. The convenience of a quick AI-generated summary costs energy and clean water that seems unjustifiable5.\nImpacts on critical thinking\nMost college students in the U.S. right now use chatGPT/AI regularly. An argument can be made that students need to be trained on proper use of AI. It is almost certain that in your professional life you will use this to some extent (or be pressured to do so for the sake of “efficiency”).\nCounterpoints: While constructing effective prompts for AI is indeed a skill to be learned, what is far more difficult is to judge what AI tells you, and that requires knowledge and critical thinking. One of the key purposes of a college education is to develop such critical thinking skills. Research clearly shows that higher confidence in LLMs/GenAI is associated with less critical thinking, while higher self-confidence is associated with more critical thinking.6 7 8 Additionally: Another purpose of college education is to prepare you for a well-rounded and successful career, and no one is looking to hire a person who pastes LLM/GenAI output and presents it as their own work.",

Once registered, students should schedule an appointment with the professor as early in the semester as possible to share the verification form and make appropriate arrangements.\n\nPlease reach out as early as possible (ideally, even before classes start) so that we can make the necessary accommodations. Note that accommodations are not retroactive and require advance notice to implement.\nNeed help with math?

However, it is not so. Scientists are flawed and human. The history of science is also a history of who got the credit and is dominated by white, male, colonialist, and racist ideas. I will try to highlight less-known historical figures and provide a critical perspective on such matters whenever possible. I see the diversity of backgrounds and identities our students bring as a strength: age, culture, disability, ethnicity, gender, nationality, religion, sexuality, and socioeconomic status. I intend for this course to serve students from diverse backgrounds and perspectives. Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated. Please let me know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally or for other students or student groups. You can do this in person during office hours, by email, or via the mid-semester anonymous survey.",
