However, it is not so. Scientists are flawed and human. The history of science is also a history of who got the credit and is dominated by white, male, colonialist, and racist ideas. I will try to highlight less-known historical figures and provide a critical perspective on such matters whenever possible. I see the diversity of backgrounds and identities our students bring as a strength: age, culture, disability, ethnicity, gender, nationality, religion, sexuality, and socioeconomic status. I intend for this course to serve students from diverse backgrounds and perspectives. Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated. Please let me know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally or for other students or student groups.
