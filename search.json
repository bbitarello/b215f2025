    "text": "In the next problem set, we plan to explore the relationship between COVID-19 death rates and vaccination rates across US states by visually examining their correlation. This analysis will involve gathering COVID-19 related data from the CDC’s API and then extensively processing it to merge the various datasets. Since the population sizes of states vary significantly, we will focus on comparing rates rather than absolute numbers. To facilitate this, we will also source population data from the US Census to accurately calculate these rates.\nIn this problem set we will learn how to extract and wrangle data from the data US Census and CDC APIs.\n\nGet an API key from the US Census at https://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html. You can’t share this public key. But your code has to run on a TFs computer. Assume the TF will have a file in their working directory named census-key.R with the following one line of code:\n\ncensus_key &lt;- \"A_CENSUS_KEY_THAT_WORKS\"\nWrite a first line of code for your problem set that defines census_key by running the code in the file census-key.R.\n\n## Your code here\n\n\nThe US Census API User Guide provides details on how to leverage this valuable resource. We are interested in vintage population estimates for years 2021 and 2022. From the documentation we find that the endpoint is:\n\n\nurl &lt;- \"https://api.census.gov/data/2021/pep/population\"\n\nUse the httr2 package to construct the following GET request.\nhttps://api.census.gov/data/2021/pep/population?get=POP_2020,POP_2021,NAME&for=state:*&key=YOURKEYHERE\nCreate an object called request of class httr2_request with this URL as an endpoint. Hint: Print out request to check that the URL matches what we want.\n\nlibrary(httr2)\n#request &lt;- \n\n\nMake a request to the US Census API using the request object. Save the response to and object named response. Check the response status of your request and make sure it was successful. You can learn about status codes here.\n\n\n#response &lt;- \n\n\nUse a function from the httr2 package to determine the content type of your response.\n\n\n# Your code here\n\n\nUse just one line of code and one function to extract the data into a matrix. Hints: 1) Use the resp_body_json function. 2) The first row of the matrix will be the variable names and this OK as we will fix in the next exercise.\n\n\n#population &lt;- \n\n\nExamine the population matrix you just created. Notice that 1) it is not tidy, 2) the column types are not what we want, and 3) the first row is a header. Convert population to a tidy dataset. Remove the state ID column and change the name of the column with state names to state_name. Add a column with state abbreviations called state. Make sure you assign the abbreviations for DC and PR correctly. Hint: Use the janitor package to make the first row the header.\n\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(janitor)\n#population &lt;- population |&gt; ## Use janitor row to names function\n  # convert to tibble\n  # remove stat column\n  # rename state column to state_name\n  # use pivot_longer to tidy\n  # remove POP_ from year\n  # parese all relevant colunns to numeric\n  # add state abbreviations using state.abb variable\n  # use case_when to add abbreviations for DC and PR\n\n\nAs a check, make a barplot of states’ 2021 and 2022 populations. Show the state names in the y-axis ordered by population size. Hint: You will need to use reorder and use facet_wrap.\n\n\n# population |&gt; \n  # reorder state\n  # assign aesthetic mapping\n  # use geom_col to plot barplot\n  # flip coordinates\n  # facet by year\n\n\nThe following URL:\n\n\nurl &lt;- \"https://github.com/datasciencelabs/2024/raw/refs/heads/main/data/regions.json\"\n\npoints to a JSON file that lists the states in the 10 Public Health Service (PHS) defined by CDC. We want to add these regions to the population dataset. To facilitate this create a data frame called regions that has two columns state_name, region, region_name. One of the regions has a long name. Change it to something shorter.\n\nlibrary(jsonlite)\nlibrary(purrr)\nurl &lt;- \"https://github.com/datasciencelabs/2024/raw/refs/heads/main/data/regions.json\"\n# regions &lt;- use jsonlit JSON parser \n# regions &lt;- convert list to data frame. You can use map_df in purrr package \n\n\nAdd a region and region name columns to the population data frame.\n\n\n# population &lt;- \n\n\nFrom reading https://data.cdc.gov/ we learn the endpoint https://data.cdc.gov/resource/pwn4-m3yp.json provides state level data from SARS-COV2 cases. Use the httr2 tools you have learned to download this into a data frame. Is all the data there? If not, comment on why.\n\n\napi &lt;- \"https://data.cdc.gov/resource/pwn4-m3yp.json\"\n# cases_raw &lt;- \n\nWe see exactly 1,000 rows. We should be seeing over \\(52 \\times 3\\) rows per state.\n\nThe reason you see exactly 1,000 rows is because CDC has a default limit. You can change this limit by adding $limit=10000000000 to the request. Rewrite the previous request to ensure that you receive all the data. Then wrangle the resulting data frame to produce a data frame with columns state, date (should be the end date) and cases. Make sure the cases are numeric and the dates are in Date ISO-8601 format.\n\n\napi &lt;- \"https://data.cdc.gov/resource/pwn4-m3yp.json\"\n# cases_raw &lt;- \n\n\nFor 2020 and 2021, make a time series plot of cases per 100,000 versus time for each state. Stratify the plot by region name. Make sure to label you graph appropriately.\n\n\n#cases |&gt;"

    "text": "In these exercises, we will explore a subset of the NHANES dataset to investigate potential differences in systolic blood pressure across groups defined by self reported race.\n\nInstructions\n\nFor each exercise, we want you to write a single line of code using the pipe (|&gt;) to chain together multiple operations. This doesn’t mean the code must fit within 80 characters or be written on a single physical line, but rather that the entire sequence of operations can be executed as one continuous line of code without needing to assign intermediate values or create new variables.\nFor example, these are three separate lines of code:\n\n\nx &lt;- 100; x &lt;- sqrt(x); log10(x)\n\nWhereas this is considered one line of code using the pipe:\n\n100 |&gt; \n  sqrt() |&gt; \n  log10()\n\n\nGenerate an html document that shows the code for each exercise.\nFor the exercises that ask to generate a graph, show the graph as well.\nFor exercises that require you to display tabular results, use the kable function to format the output as a clean, readable table. Do not display the raw dataframe directly—only show the nicely formatted table using kable.\nUse only two significant digits for the numbers displayed in the tables.\nSubmit both the html and the qmd files using Git.\nYou will need the following libraries:\n\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(tidyr)\nlibrary(forcats)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(knitr)\nlibrary(NHANES)\noptions(digits = 2)\n\n\nThe .qmd file must be able to render properly on the TFs’ computers. They will already have the necessary packages installed, so there is no need to include code for installing packages. Just focus on writing the code that uses these packages.\n\n\n\nExercises\n\nFilter the NHANES data to only include survey year 2011-2012. Save the resulting table in dat. This table should have 5,000 rows and 76 columns.\n\n\n## code here\n\n\nCompute the average and standard deviation (SD) for the combined systolic blood pressure (SBP) reading for males and females separately. Show us a data frame with two rows (female and male) and two columns (average and SD).\n\n\n## code here\n\n\nBecause of the large difference in the average between males and females, we will perform the rest of the analysis separately for males and females.\n\nCompute the average and SD for SBP for each race variable in column Race3 for females and males separately. The resulting table should have four columns for sex, race, average, and SD, respectively, and 12 rows (one for each strata). Arrange the result from highest to lowest average.\n\n## code here\n\n\nRepeat the previous exercise but add two columns to the final table to show a 95% confidence interval. Specifically, add columns with the lower and upper bounds of the interval with names lower and upper, respectively. The formula for these values is\n\n\\[\n\\bar{X} \\pm 1.96 \\, s / \\sqrt{n}\n\\] with \\(\\bar{X}\\) the sample average and \\(s\\) the sample standard deviation. This table will simply add two more columns to the table generated in the previous exercise: one column for the lower and upper bound, respectively.\n\n## code here\n\n\nMake a graph of showing the results from the previous exercise. Specifically, plot the averages for each group as points and confidence intervals as error bars (use the geometry geom_errorbar). Order the groups from lowest to highest average (the average of the males and females averages). Use facet_wrap to make a separate plot for females and males. Label your axes with Race and Average respectively, add the title Comparing systolic blood pressure across groups, and the caption Bars represent 95% confidence intervals.\n\n\n## code here\n\n\nIn the plot above we see that the confidence intervals don’t overlap when comparing the White and Mexican groups. We also see a substantial difference between Mexican and Hispnanic. Before concluding that there is a difference between groups, we will explore if differences in age, a very common confounder, explain the differences.\n\nCreate table like the one in the previous exercise but show the average SBP by sex and age group (AgeDecade). The the groups are order chronologically. As before make a separate plot for males and females. Make sure to filter our observations with no AgeDecade listed.\n\n## code here\n\n\nWe note that for both males and females the SBP increases with age. To explore if age is indeed a confounder we need to check if the groups have different age distributions.\n\nExplore the age distributions of each Race3 group to determine if the groups are comparable. Make a histogram of Age for each Race3 group and stack them vertically. Generate two columns of graphs for males and females, respectively. In the histograms, create bins increments of 5 years up to 80.\nBelow the graph, comment on what notice about the age distributions and how this can explain the difference between the White and Mexican groups.\n\n## code here\n\n\nSummarize the results shown in the graph by compute the median age for each Race3 group and the percent of individuals that are younger than 18. Order the rows by median age. The resulting data frame should have 6 rows (one for each group) and three columns to denote group, median age, and children respectively.\n\n\n## code here\n\nGiven these results provide an explanation for the difference in systolic pressure is lower when comparing the White and Mexican groups.\n\nWhen the age distribution between two populations we can’t conclude that there are differences in SBP based just on the population averages. The observed differences are likely due to age differences rather than genetic differences. We will therefore stratify by group and then compare SBP. But before we do this, we might need redefine dat to avoid small groups.\n\nWrite a function that computes the number of observations in each gender, age group and race combination. Show the groups with less than five observations. Make sure to remove the rows with no BPSysAve measurments before calculating the number of observations. Show a table with four columns representing gender, age strate, group, and the number of individuals in that group. Make sure to include combinations with 0 individuals (hint: use complete).\n\n## code here\n\n\nBased on the observations made in the previous exercise, we will redefine dat but with the following:\n\nAs before, include only survey year 2011-2012.\nRemove the observations with no age group reported.\nRemove the 0-9 age group.\nCombine the 60-69 and 70+ ageroups into a 60+ group.\nRemove observations reporting Other in Race3.\nRename the variable Race3 to Race.\n\nHints:\n\nNote that the levels in AgeDecade start with a space.\nYou can use the fct_collapse function in the forcats to combine factors.\n\n\n\n## code here\n\n\nCrete a plot that shows the averege BPS for each age decade. Show the different race groups with color and lines joining them. Generate a two plots, one for males and one for females.\n\n\n## code here\n\n\nBased on the plot above pick two groups that you think are consistently different and remake the plot from the previous exercise but just for these two groups, add confidence intervals, and remove the lines. Put the confidence intervals for each age strata next to each other and use color to represent the two groups. Comment on your finding.\n\n\n## code here\n\n\nFor the two groups that you selected above compute the difference in average BPS between the two groups for each age strata. Show a table with three columns representing age strata, difference for females, difference for males.\n\n\n## code here"

Polls based on ‘voters’ are exit polls. We want to remove these because exit polls are too old or might be biased due to differences in the likelihood of early voter by party. We prefer likely voter (lv) polls because they are more predictive. Registered voter polls are more predictive than all voter (a) polls. Remove the exit poll (v) polls and then redefine population to be a factor ordered from best to worse predictive power: (lv, rv, a). You should also remove hypothetical polls and make the date columns into date objects. Name the resulting data frame dat.\n\n\ndat &lt;- raw_dat |&gt; \n  ## Your code here\n\n\nSome polls asked more than one questions. So if you filter to one poll ID in our dataset, you might see more than one question ID associated with the same poll. The most common reason for this is that they asked a head-to-head question (Harris versus Trump) and, in the same poll, a question about all candidates. We want to prioritize the head-to-head questions.\n\nAdd a column that tells us, for each question, how many candidates where mentioned in that question.\nAdd a new column n to dat that provides the number of candidates mentioned for each question. For example the relevant column of your final table will looks something like this:\n\n\n\npoll_id\nquestion_id\ncandidate\nn\n\n\n\n\n1\n1\nHarris\n2\n\n\n1\n1\nTrump\n2\n\n\n1\n2\nHarris\n3\n\n\n1\n2\nTrump\n3\n\n\n1\n2\nStein\n3\n\n\n\n\ndat &lt;- dat |&gt; \n    ## Your code here\n\n\nWe are going to focus on the Harris versus Trump comparison. Redefine dat to only include the rows providing information for Harris and Trump. Then pivot the dataset so that the percentages for Harris and Trump are in their own columns. Note that for pivot to work you will have to remove some columns. To avoid this keep only the columns you are pivoting and along with poll_id, question_id, state, pollster, start_date, end_date, numeric_grade, sample_size. Once you accomplish the pivot, add a column called spread with the difference between Harris and Trump.\n\nNote that the values stored in spread are estimates of the popular vote difference that we will use to predict for the competition:\nspread = % of the popular vote for Harris - % of the popular vote for Trump\nHowever, for the calculations in the rest of problem set to be consistent with the sampling model we have been discussing in class, save spread as a proportion, not a percentage. But remember to turn it back to a percentage when submitting your entry to the competition.\n\ndat &lt;- dat |&gt;\n  ## Your code here\n\n\nNote that some polls have multiple questions. We want to keep only one question per poll. We will keep likely voter (lv) polls when available, and prefer register voter (rv) over all voter polls (a). If more than one question was asked in one poll, take the most targeted question (smallest n). Save the resulting tabledat.

We recommend using the following column names: date, state, cases, hosp, deaths, vax, booster, and population.\n\nKey Considerations\n\nAlign reporting periods: Ensure that the time periods for which each outcome is reported are consistent. Specifically, calculate the totals for each Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR) period.\nHarmonize variable names: To facilitate the joining of datasets, rename variables so that they match across all datasets.\n\n\nOne challenge is data frames use different column names to represent the same variable. Examine each data frame and report back 1) the name of the column with state abbreviations, 2) if the it’s yearly, monthly, or weekly, daily data, 3) all the column names that provide date information.\n\n\n\n\nOutcome\nJurisdiction variable name\nRate\ntime variable names\n\n\n\n\ncases\n\n\n\n\n\nhospitalizations\n\n\n\n\n\ndeaths\n\n\n\n\n\nvaccines\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWrangle the cases data frame to keep state MMWR year, MMWR week, and the total number of cases for that week in that state. Keep only states for which we have population estimates. Hint: Use as_date, ymd_hms, epiweek and epiyear functions in the lubridate package. Comment appropriately.\nNow repeat the same exercise for hospitalizations. Note that you will have to collapse the data into weekly data and keep the same columns as in the cases dataset, except keep total weekly hospitalizations instead of cases. Remove weeks with less than 7 days reporting. Add this code to wrangle.R and comment appropriately.\nRepeat what you did in the previous two exercises for provisional COVID-19 deaths. Add this code to wrangle.R and comment appropriately.\nRepeat this now for vaccination data. Keep the variables series_complete and booster along with state and date. Add this code to wrangle.R and comment appropriately.\nNow we are ready to join the tables. We will only consider 2020 and 2021 as we don’t have population sizes for 2022. However, because we want to guarantee that all dates are included we will create a data frame with all possible weeks. Add this code to your wrangle.R file. We can use this:\n\n\n## Make dates data frame\nall_dates &lt;- data.frame(date = seq(make_date(2020, 1, 25),\n                                   make_date(2021, 12, 31), \n                                   by = \"week\")) |&gt;\n  mutate(date = ceiling_date(date, unit = \"week\", week_start = 7) - days(1)) |&gt;\n  mutate(mmwr_year = epiyear(date), mmwr_week = epiweek(date)) \n\ndates_and_pop &lt;- cross_join(all_dates, data.frame(state = unique(population$state))) |&gt; left_join(population, by = c(\"state\", \"mmwr_year\" = \"year\"))\n\nNow join all the table to create your final table.

    "text": "10.1 Rationale for the LLM/GenAI policy adopted here\nWhile there are many worthy uses of AI (e.g., predicting protein structures based on aminoacid sequences, which has been underway for over a decade), the widespread use of LLMs/GenAI for the most mundane tasks and internet searches has an enormous ecological impact.\nClimate Change\nData centers already consume about 2% of the global electricity output (as of December 20242, likely much more now). These data centers emit enormous amounts of CO2, are mostly powered by non-renewable energy sources – for example, projected growth demands on energy grids to keep up with data center development plans are already delaying the retirement of coal power plants in the U.S.3 – and consume an enormous amount of clean freshwater4. The convenience of a quick AI-generated summary costs energy and clean water that seems unjustifiable5.\nImpacts on critical thinking\nMost college students in the U.S. right now use chatGPT/AI regularly. An argument can be made that students need to be trained on proper use of AI. It is almost certain that in your professional life you will use this to some extent (or be pressured to do so for the sake of “efficiency”).\nCounterpoints: While constructing effective prompts for AI is indeed a skill to be learned, what is far more difficult is to judge what AI tells you, and that requires knowledge and critical thinking. One of the key purposes of a college education is to develop such critical thinking skills. Research clearly shows that higher confidence in LLMs/GenAI is associated with less critical thinking, while higher self-confidence is associated with more critical thinking.6 7 8 Additionally: Another purpose of college education is to prepare you for a well-rounded and successful career, and no one is looking to hire a person who pastes LLM/GenAI output and presents it as their own work.",

However, it is not so. Scientists are flawed and human. The history of science is also a history of who got the credit and is dominated by white, male, colonialist, and racist ideas. I will try to highlight less-known historical figures and provide a critical perspective on such matters whenever possible. I see the diversity of backgrounds and identities our students bring as a strength: age, culture, disability, ethnicity, gender, nationality, religion, sexuality, and socioeconomic status. I intend for this course to serve students from diverse backgrounds and perspectives. Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated. Please let me know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally or for other students or student groups.
