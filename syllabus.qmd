# Textbook

-   The Analysis of Biological Data (3rd or 2nd edition), by Whitlock & Schluter.
-   Please make sure you also bring a laptop to labs. You may borrow one from the bio department. Please email if this is your case.

# Other materials

For labs you will need a laptop with a browser. Tbalets in my experience will not work. If you need, you can borrow a laptop from the bio department. Email our admin Andrew (agalleghe\[at\]brynmawr.edu).

For exams you may use a calculator to save you time. A scientific calculator with roots, exponents,etc, is fine, but graphic/function calculators will NOT be accepted. Please plan accordingly. A scientific calculator is \~ \$12 and you might also be able to borrow one from a buddy or the college (email your dean for the latter option).

## Course Description

Statistics came from biology. For 15+ years, a solid foundation in statistics and R has been the standard tool for performing statistics in biology, health studies, data science, and many other fields. Because of this, **B215 is neither just a biostatistics course nor simply an R programming course**: it is a biostatistics course where R is directly integrated into the learning process. We will focus mainly on classic statistics (so-called frequentist ) and probability theory, but we will also have an introduction to the increasingly relevant Bayesian statistics approach.

Throughout the course, **we use motivating case studies and data analysis problem sets and R labs based on similar challenges to those one finds in scientific research**.

## Topics we (aim to) cover

-   Sampling & Experimental Design
-   Descriptive statistics
-   Data visualization
-   Probability Theory
-   Estimation & Hypothesis Testing
-   The Normal Distribution
-   Comparing samples & Correlations
-   Bootstrapping and permutation
-   Bayesian vs Likelihood approaches
-   Bootstrapping & Permutation Tests Likelihood & Bayesian Statistics

## Weekly Course Structure

-   **Monday and Wednesday lectures**: Focus on concepts and (manual) problem solving. In-class activities will occur often and count towards your grade.
-   **Tuesday labs**: R computer lab (bring your laptop) with guided tutorial. Activity is due by the end of the day.

**Please ensure that you read the chapters listed in the syllabus before each Monday.** The lectures are designed with the assumption that you have completed the readings, enabling us to dive deeper into nuances, applications, and questions.

**Lectures will not be recorded.**

We have [Piazza](https://piazza.com/brynmawr/fall2025/bmcbiolb215001f25) set up for you to ask questions during and after class. Professor and TA will check this often and it is the preferred method to get our help. Also, see office hours schedule.

## Grade Distribution

| Component           | Weight |
|:--------------------|:-------|
| Homework (several)  | 12%    |
| Problem sets (3)    | 18 %   |
| Lab Assignments (2) | 20%    |
| Midterm 1           | 18%    |
| Final exam          | 18%    |
| Coding Interview    | 14%    |

Final grades will likely be assigned as follows (if curving is performed, it could increase but not decrease your grade):

| Min % | BMC scale |
|:------|:----------|
| 93    | 4         |
| 90    | 3.7       |
| 87    | 3.3       |
| 83    | 3.0       |
| 80    | 2.7       |
| 77    | 2.3       |
| 70    | 2.0       |

## Problem Sets

Problem sets will be due every week or every other week, depending on difficulty. They will be due at 11:59 PM on the day denoted on the Problem Sets page.

Some problem sets include open ended questions that may be challenging. If you need help, go to office hours where you can get help with unanswered questions. You may also post clarifying questions on Piazza under the appropriate topic.


10% of the total points for the problem sets will be deducted for every late day. **Students can have a total of 4 late days without penalty during the entire semester.** No need to provide a written excuse. **Providing an excuse does not give you more days** unless an accommodation is requested and approved by your dean.

# Lab Assignments

Lab assignments must be submitted via GitHub. **Students are required to have a GitHub account and create a repository for the course.** We will be providing further instructions during the first lab.

Lab assignment submissions need to be completely reproducible R markdown documents. **If your R markdown file does not compile** it will be considered a late day, and you will be notified and will need to resubmit a R markdown file that does compile. You will be deducted further late days for every day it takes for you to turn in a Quarto file that does knit. 

Problem sets must be submitted via GitHub. **Students are required to have a GitHub account and create a repository for the course.** We will be providing further instructions during the first lab.

## Midterm Policy

**Both midterms are closed book, no internet.** You may use certain calculator (see above) and you will be allowed one sheet of standard paper with hand-written notes (front and back) to assist you. Your thought process must be explained for all answers and your final answer clearly marked. Questions will drawn from or similar to problem sets.

Please make sure you can come to class on the midterm dates provided in the **Key Dates** table below. If you absolutely must miss the exam, you will need approval from your dean and myself before the exam in order to have a makeup. All make-up exams will be completely different from the in-class ones.

## Large Language Models (LLMs) Policy

### **My philosophy**

**LLMs for learning?** Research clearly shows that when used in the ways many students do, it hampers the development of critical thinking, which is one of the purposes of a college education. \[add refs\] Furthermore, I am 100% sure that no one is looking to hire a person who pastes LLM output and presents it as their own work. The main reason I avoid this tool at all costs is its devastating impact on our already out of control climate catastrophe \[add refs\].

**LLMs and their climate impact.**

### **So can you use ir or not?** 

**You should NOT use LLMs to do your work:** i.e., it should not write answers for you, write text for you, or produce code for you. That being said, you can use it for learning if you wish, as detailed below.

For **Lab assignments**, you can use it to understand things (e.g, to understand a cryptic error message) just as I am ok with you using web searches in general (Stack Overflow will be way more helpful to you than LLMs, by the way). To this day, I have never had help from an LLM on a coding error that I could not figure out from online posts in forums. If you do use it for a lab assignment, you will be required to include citations for each instance where you used it, including the prompt you used.

For problem sets: I prefer you don't use it for this as there is no reason to do so. The whole point of problem sets is to practice for the exams, and I will grade these benevolently as described below. Do remember **you won't be able to use it during the midterms or during your coding interview.**

## Benevolent grading

Since problem sets and lab assignments are formative, i.e, their purpose is learning, I will grade them benevolently follow this rubric:


| Grade (%) | Description |
|:-|:------|
| 100 % | Grades $> 90%$ will be rounded up. |
| 70-90% | Complete and various degrees of incorrect answers: 3 + major errors (\~70%) to a few minor errors (\~ 90%) |
| 60% | Complete but sloppy or excessive amount of major errors. |
| 50% | Incomplete (not everything was answered) |
| 0% | Plagiarism (inclduing innapropriate LLM use) |
