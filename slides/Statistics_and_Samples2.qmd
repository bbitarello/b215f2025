## Quick recap

Last lecture we discussed:

-   Population vs. sample
-   Parameter vs. estimate
-   The two types of errors associated with sampling: sampling error and sampling bias

::: notes
Ask for volunteers to remind these concepts
:::

## Today

-   ~~Goals of statistics~~
-   ~~Populations and Samples~~
-   ~~Statistics and parameters~~
-   **Estimate errors due to sampling**
-   **Types of experiments**
-   **Types of variables**

## Learning Goals

-   ~~Understand the major goal of statistics~~
-   ~~Distinguish between a sample and a population~~
-   ~~Distinguish between an estimate and a parameter~~
-   Identify why estimates from samples may deviate from parameters of populations
-   Identify the properties of a good sample
-   Be able to detect the differences between observational and experimental studies

::: notes
These learning goals are for the entire topic/unit. They will also be available in the study guide.
:::

## Volunteer bias

::: goal
Volunteers for a study are likely to be different, on average, from the population.
:::

For example:

-   Volunteers for sex studies are more likely to be open about sex.
-   In surveys about sexual activity, gender biases answers in opposite directions.
-   Volunteers for medical studies may be sicker than the general population.
-   Animals that are caught may be slower or more docile than those that are not.
-   The case we saw about the 1936 U.S. elections.

::: notes
Ask for volunteers to name some. The US elections example also involves sample of convenience.
:::

## Sample of convenience

::: goal
A sample of convenience is a collection of individuals that happen to be available at the time.

> A convenience sample is the one that is drawn from a source that is conveniently accessible to the researcher.

> A purposive sample is the one whose characteristics are defined for a purpose that is relevant to the study.

## Sample of convenience

Problems:

::: nonincremental
-   "In research, we therefore implicitly seek to generalize the findings from our sample to the entire population, present and future."[^2]
:::

::: incremental
-   low generalizability. What is true for your sample might not reflect what is true for the population.
-   in practice, you can only generalize findings to the subpopulation from which the sample was taken from.
-   sometimes, a sample of convenience is the best option researchers have (e.g. studies that extract data from national healthcare or insurance databases)
-   It is rarely possible to draw a truly random sample from the population
:::

. . .

This does not invalidate the studies in question. They can have high "internal validity". The issue is with generalizing, i.e, its external validity.

. . .

::: notes
However, this is possible only if our sample is representative of the population; a sample is likely to be representative of the population only if it is randomly drawn from the population.
:::

## What about sampling error?

::: goal
Sampling error: Chance deviations between estimates and the truth.
:::

. . .

Even when you did NOTHING wrong.

. . .

. . .

::: goal
Sampling error is the difference between the estimate and its true parameter value — and it can be quantified!
:::

## Sampling error

-   Even if you sample perfectly, by the book, your estimates will differ from the true parameter.

-   Unlike bias, it is not systematic. Rather, it is governed by chance and does not occur in a systematic direction

E.g: average horn size in rhinoceros taken from two same-sized samples from the same population (unbiased samples) might (very likely) will give estimates that differ to some extent from each other but without a clear “direction”

## Example of sampling error

to do: use R code

## Sampling error declines with sample size

to do: use R code

## Estimates are random variables

-   Because an estimate is a random variable, the value of an estimate is influenced by chance.

-   Therefore estimates will differ among random samples from the same population.

::: notes
we're assuming here that we don't have the bias issue discussed for this example previously.

## How bias and sampling error affect estimates

::::::: columns
:::: {.column width="50%"}
::: r-stack
**Sampling Bias**
:::

-   Systematic difference between estimates & parameters.
-   Driven by bias in the sampling process (i.e., sample not random in relation to the population of interest), regarless of sample size.
::::

:::: {.column width="50%\""}
::: r-stack
**Sampling Error**
:::

-   Undirected deviation of estimates away from parameters.
-   Driven by chance.
-   Decreases with sample size.
::::

## Goals of estimation

::: goal
Accuracy (on average gets the correct answer)
:::

::: goal
Precision (gives a similar answer repeatedly)
:::

## Sampling error vs bias: Practical example

use R code

Properties of a good sample

-   A good sample is made up of a **random and independent** selection of a sufficiently large number of individuals.

-   In a random sample, each member of a population has an equal and independent chance of being selected

-   Equality: probability of being selected reflects its representation in the population

-   Independence: no influence of sampling one individual on other individuals that get sampled.

## Random samples

::: Goal
Taking random samples is hard and requires effort
:::

Why are they important? Reduce sampling bias

How to get a random sample (ideal):

![](images/clipboard-4130122363.png){fig-align="center" width="608"} Carefully characterize a population and use computer code to select participants randomly.
