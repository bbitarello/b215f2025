::: {.column width=\"70%\"}
-   Bárbara D. Bitarello (she/her/hers)
-   PhD in human evolutionary genetics
-   Professor \\@ BMC since July 2021
-   Computational biologist/population geneticist/evolutionary biologist/statistical geneticist, etc
-   Interested in all things related to evolution
:::

## Our TA

-   Nicole Cavalieri

-   English Major/ Data Science Minor

-   R rockstar!

## Pre-Reqs

-   No prior experience with programming is required!
-   BIOL B110 or B111 highly recommended (though not required). **Why?** Examples are heavily focused on biology, though the concepts and skills learned will be transferable
-   Students who have taken PSYC B205/H200 or SOCL B265 are [not]{.underline} eligible to take this course.
-   High school algebra - if you’re not sure, I recommend checking [Khan Academy - Algebra Basics](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra-basics) for a recap

## Logistics

Everything I am about to say is in the syllabus!

-   Materials
-   Things to do/install
-   Course structure
-   Policies
-   How to succeed

## Materials

::::: columns
::: {.column width=\"50%\"}
-   Textbook: Whitlock and Schluter *The Analysis of Biological Data*, 3rd edition (2nd: ok, but check pages)

![](images/textbook.png){fig-alt="Cover of the 3rd edition of the textbook"}
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Laptop with browser for labs
-   Scientific calculator (not graphing calculator) $\sim\$12$
-   [Scientific vs Graphing Calculator](https://www.architecturelab.net/whats-the-difference-between-scientific-and-graphing-calculator/)
:::
:::::

## Tech things to do

-   Have a laptop for labs and calculator for exams
-   Join Piazza
-   Make accounts in DataCamp and Posit Cloud using BMC/HC email
-   Then accept invite sent by email (check spam)

## Other things to do

-   Read course info document and schedule (posted on Moodle)
-   Answer pre-course survey
-   Check course schedule and reach out asap if there are issues
-   Check midterm dates and plan accordingly

## Course Pages

-   Course website: <https://bbitarello.github.io/b215f2025/> has syllabus, schedule, etc.
-   All assignments must be uploaded on Moodle (except DataCamp)
-   Keys, slides, study guides will also be posted on Moodle

## Course Pages

-   Piazza is the preferred method for any questions that may benefit classmates, both logistical and content-related
-   Piazza allows you to post anonymously (note: I will still know your identity)

::: aside
Datacamp and Posit Cloud will also be used weekly so join asap!

## Course Structure

![](images/figs.003.png)

::: notes
Lectures: Statistical concepts, address questions based on readings. In-class activities will occur often and count towards participation. Lectures are designed with the assumption that you have completed the pre-assigned readings, enabling us to dive deeper into nuances, applications, and questions. Labs: R computer lab (bring your laptop) with guided tutorial. R Labs are due by the end of the day.

## Formative vs Summative Assessments

## Formative Assessments

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Formative assessments happen often and are focused on learning
-   DC and R labs are gladed for completion/effort
-   Quizzes may be taken multiple times (final grade is average)
-   PS graded benevolently
-   Allows instructor to adjust pace and support
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
![](images/figs.005.png){fig-alt="Low-stakes: easy points for practicing. Includes: DataCamp (weekly), R labs, small group problem solving in class, Moodle quiz, 5 problem sets"}
:::
:::::

## Summative Assessments

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Evaluate students' individual progress: have they met the learning goals? Have they mastered the material?
-   Typically occur at the end of a learning period
-   The first coding assignment will actually be formative and you will be allowed to resubmit; the 2nd will be summative
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
![](images/figs.006.png){fig-alt="Coding assignments (independent data exploration, opportunity to showcase and intrgrate the lab and lectures) and 2 closed book in class midterms (one page of notes and calculator are allowed)" width="470"}
:::
:::::

## DataCamp

-   Assigned weekly to practice lab skills
-   DC shows the hard deadlines but ideally you should complete the weekly DC activities as they are assigned, weekly

## Attendance and Late Work

-   Please communicate need to miss class by email.
-   Grace days: every one gets 4, no questions asked, just email a day before deadline and say how many days you need for a given assignment
-   Late work otherwise penalyzed -10% per day

## AI policy

We are following the BMC Honor Code. Please see syllabus.

Questions about this: now or later on Piazza.

## FAQs answered in the syllabus

Please visit the FAQ section of the syllabus. A few examples...

1.  What if I have to miss class?
2.  What if I cannot turn in an assignment in time?
3.  What if I am requesting an extension because of sickness?
4.  What if I have accommodations?

## How to succeed

-   Attendance
-   Pre-class prep
-   Complete all activities — be consistent and diligent
-   Check Piazza regularly, attend office hours at least 2x
-   Don’t leave everything for last minute — that will not work well
-   Communicate proactively
