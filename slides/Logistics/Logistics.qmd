# Pre-Reqs

-    No prior experience with programming is required!
-    BIOL B110 or B111 highly recommended (though not required). **Why?** Examples are heavily focused on biology, though the concepts and skills learned will be transferable
-   Students who have taken PSYC B205/H200 or SOCL B265 are [not]{.underline} eligible to take this course.
-  High school algebra - if you’re not sure, I recommend checking [Khan Academy - Algebra Basics](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra-basics) for a recap

# Course Structure

![](images/figs.003.png)

::: notes
Lectures: Statistical concepts, address questions based on readings. In-class activities will occur often and count towards participation. Lectures are designed with the assumption that you have completed the pre-assigned readings, enabling us to dive deeper into nuances, applications, and questions. Labs: R computer lab (bring your laptop) with guided tutorial. R Labs are due by the end of the day.
:::

# Formative vs Summative Assessments

-   Formative assessments happen often and are focused on learning
-   DC and R labs are gladed for completion/effort
-   Quizzes may be taken multiple times (final grade is average)
-   PS graded benevolently

![](images/figs.005.png)

# DataCamp

-   Assigned weekly to practice lab skills
-   DC shows the hard deadlines but ideally you should complete the weekly DC activities as they are assigned, weekly

# Attendance and Late Work

-   Please communicate need to miss class by email.
-   Grace days: every one gets 4, no questions asked, just email a day before deadline and say how many days you need for a given assignment
-   Late work otherwise penalyzed -10% per day

# AI policy

We are following the BMC Honor Code. Please see syllabus.

Questions about this: now or later on Piazza.
