# Making a web page


## HTML 

It's worth learning HTML and CSS

Here a very basic HTML page:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Basic HTML Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello BST 260!</h1>
    <p>This is a very basic HTML page.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

On most web servers, the URL will default to the file `index.html`

CSS is used to change the style, whle keeping the HTML the same:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Basic HTML Page with CSS</title>
    <style>
        body {
            font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
            background-color: #f0f0f0;
            margin: 0;
            padding: 0;
        }

        h1 {
            color: navy;
            text-align: center;
        }

        p {
            color: #333333;
            margin-left: 20px;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello BST 260!</h1>
    <p>This is a very basic HTML page with some CSS styling.</p>
</body>
</html>
```


Usually, we keep the CSS in a separate file, as they can be quite long. You can Typically we call the file `sytle.css`.

```
body {
    font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
    background-color: #f0f0f0;
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
}

h1 {
    color: navy;
    text-align: center;
}

p {
    color: #333333;
    margin-left: 20px;
}
```

Then we add a line to the html file to make let the browser know to use the style:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Basic HTML Page with External CSS</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello Hello BST 260!!</h1>
    <p>This is a very basic HTML page with external CSS styling.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

There are many css file you can borrow to make the page follow different styles.

## Markdown

* To avoid learning HTML syntax you can instead use markdown to create pages. 

* Markdown is what Quarto is based on. If you remove the runable code from quarto it becomes a markdown document.

* GitHub uses markdown for the README files shown in repositores.

        - Example: <https://github.com/datasciencelabs/2023>
        - Code: <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datasciencelabs/2023/main/README.md>

* GitHub converts it to HTML for you so it looks _pretty_.

## Making a GitHub ready markdown in Quarto

If you use the header

``` 
---
format: gfm
---
```
## GitHub Welcome page

You can easily have a nice introductory page like this one:

https://github.com/rafalab

* Go to your GitHub account. 

* Create a repo with the same name as your username. For example, I created a repo called `rafalab`

* Add a README.md file like this:

```
### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- I am NAME. I am a student at HSPH.
- I am studying Biostatistics.
- I keep examples of my work in this GitHub repo
- Follow me @handle
```

## GitHub pages

You can use GitHub pages to create a webpage using only markdown.

You can create a homw page with URL `http://username.github.io/`

But also webpages for projects with URLs `http://username.github.io/project-name`


Try it out:

## Bookdown

The R package bookdown makes it very easy to create books with quarto. We can easily share these on GitHub.

## Blogdown

Similarly, the bloogdown pacakge lets you write a blog with quarto.
