    "text": "Course Description\nStatistics came from biology. For 15+ years, a solid foundation in statistics and R has been the standard tool for performing statistics in biology, health studies, data science, and many other fields. Because of this, B215 is neither just a biostatistics course nor simply an R programming course: it is a biostatistics course where R is directly integrated into the learning process. We will focus mainly on classic statistics (so-called frequentist ) and probability theory, but we will also have an introduction to the increasingly relevant Bayesian statistics approach.\nThroughout the course, we use motivating case studies and data analysis problem sets and R labs based on similar challenges to those one finds in scientific research.",

    "text": "Large Language Models (LLMs) Policy\n\nMy philosophy\nLLMs for learning? Research clearly shows that when used in the ways many students do, it hampers the development of critical thinking, which is one of the purposes of a college education. [add refs] Furthermore, I am 100% sure that no one is looking to hire a person who pastes LLM output and presents it as their own work. The main reason I avoid this tool at all costs is its devastating impact on our already out of control climate catastrophe [add refs].\nLLMs and their climate impact.\n\n\nSo can you use ir or not?\nYou should NOT use LLMs to do your work: i.e., it should not write answers for you, write text for you, or produce code for you. That being said, you can use it for learning if you wish, as detailed below.\nFor Lab assignments, you can use it to understand things (e.g, to understand a cryptic error message) just as I am ok with you using web searches in general (Stack Overflow will be way more helpful to you than LLMs, by the way). To this day, I have never had help from an LLM on a coding error that I could not figure out from online posts in forums. If you do use it for a lab assignment, you will be required to include citations for each instance where you used it, including the prompt you used.\nFor problem sets: I prefer you don’t use it for this as there is no reason to do so. The whole point of problem sets is to practice for the exams, and I will grade these benevolently as described below. Do remember you won’t be able to use it during the midterms or during your coding interview.",
