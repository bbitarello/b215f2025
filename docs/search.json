    "text": "Course Description\nStatistics came from biology. For 15+ years, a solid foundation in statistics and R has been the standard tool for performing statistics in biology, health studies, data science, and many other fields. Because of this, B215 is neither just a biostatistics course nor simply an R programming course: it is a biostatistics course where R is directly integrated into the learning process. We will focus mainly on classic statistics (so-called frequentist ) and probability theory, but we will also have an introduction to the increasingly relevant Bayesian statistics approach.\nThroughout the course, we use motivating case studies and data analysis problem sets and R labs based on similar challenges to those one finds in scientific research.",

The lectures are designed with the assumption that you have completed the readings, enabling us to dive deeper into nuances, applications, and questions.\nLectures will not be recorded.\nWe have Piazza set up for you to ask questions during and after class.

They will be due at 11:59 PM on the day denoted on the Problem Sets page.\nSome problem sets include open ended questions that will be difficult to answer on your own. We will be working on these together during Wednesday labs. We also offer office hours where you can get help with unanswered questions.\nProblem sets must be submitted via GitHub. Students are required to have a GitHub account and create a repository for the course. We will be providing further instructions during the first lab.\n10% of the total points for the problem sets will be deducted for every late day. Students can have a total of 4 late days without penalty during the entire semester. No need to provide a written excuse. Providing an excuse does not give you more days unless an accommodation is requested and approved by the Office of Student Affairs (this includes COVID).\nProblem set submissions need to be completely reproducible Quarto documents. If your Quarto file does not compile it will be considered a late day, and you will be notified and will need to resubmit a Quarto file that does compile. You will be deducted further late days for every day it takes for you to turn in a Quarto file that does knit. You are required to check emails that come through the Canvas system, as this the only way we will communicate problems with your problem sets.",

Where different age groups affected differently?\n\nOptionally, you can select a question that align with your ongoing research. This way, it can be directly beneficial to your work. This will require prior approval from the instructor by October 25.\nYet another option is to build a interactive webpage with poll-driven predictions for the 2024 US elections. Note this will be more challenging as we will not cover tools for interactive webpages until the last week of class (time permitting).\nNote: You should start working on your project after the first midterm. Do not wait until the last week. Teaching staff will be available during office hours.",
