    "text": "13.4 So can you use ir or not?\nAgain, from the Bryn Mawr Honor code:\n\nGenerative AI tools should not be used in the completion of any course assignments, exams, or written work, including laboratory work, unless an instructor for a given course has specifically and explicitly authorized their use for the assignment in question. Presenting AI-generated content as original student work, submitting AI-generated content without citing its source in artificial intelligence tools, and relying on generative AI tools for closed-book quizzes, tests, and exams all constitute violations of the Honor Code.\n\nFrom me: the above excerpt summarizes the policy for this course. Now the specifics:\nFor Lab assignments ONLY you can use it to understand things (e.g, to understand a cryptic error message) just as I am ok with you using web searches in general. I will give specific instructions about this in the assignments but, briefly, for the lab assignments you may search for help on the web, including the LLMs. If you do use LLMs for a lab assignment, you will be required to include citations for each instance where you used it, including the prompt you used. You are also required to cite any other sources of information.\nNote: Stack Overflow and other programming forums online + office hours will be way more helpful to your lasting learning and what you will take from this course than LLMs, by the way. I have never had help from an LLM on a coding error that I could not figure out from online posts in forums.\nFor homework and problem sets: Please don’t use, as there is (ethical) reason to do so. The whole point of these is to learn and/or practice for the exams, and I will grade these benevolently as described below.\nLastly, do remember you won’t be able to use A.I or any other external sources during the midterms or during your coding interview.",

Title IX prohibits discrimination based on sex in any federally funded educational program or activity, and forms the basis for Bryn Mawr’s policies and resources regarding sex discrimination. The Bryn Mawr College Sexual Misconduct Policy prohibits Title IX sexual harassment, which includes sexual assault, dating violence, domestic violence, and stalking. Bryn Mawr’s Policy is more extensive than Title IX, and also covers other gender-based misconduct. BMC’s Policy is more extensive than Title IX, and also covers other gender-based misconduct.\n\nSee more here.\nFrom me: Please be aware that all Bryn Mawr/Haverford employees (other than those designated as confidential resources such as counselors, clergy, and healthcare providers) must report information about such discrimination and harassment to Bi-Co Tittle IX Coordinator.",

Note that accommodations are not retroactive and require advance notice to implement.\nNeed help with math?
