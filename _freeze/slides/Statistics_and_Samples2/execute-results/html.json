They will also be available in the study guide.\n:::\n\n## Volunteer bias\n\n::: goal\nVolunteers for a study are likely to be different, on average, from the population.\n:::\n\nFor example:\n\n-   Volunteers for sex studies are more likely to be open about sex.\n-   In surveys about sexual activity, gender biases answers in opposite directions.\n-   Volunteers for medical studies may be sicker than the general population.\n-   Animals that are caught may be slower or more docile than those that are not.\n-   The case we saw about the 1936 U.S. elections.\n\n::: notes\nAsk for volunteers to name some. The US elections example also involves sample of convenience.\n:::\n\n## Sample of convenience\n\n::: goal\nA sample of convenience is a collection of individuals that happen to be available at the time.\n:::\n\nOther definitions[^1]:\n\n[^1]: Andrade C (2021). The Inconvenient Truth About Convenience and Purposive Samples. Indian J Psychol Med, 43(1):86-88. Doi: 10.1177/0253717620977000\n\n> A convenience sample is the one that is drawn from a source that is conveniently accessible to the researcher.\n\n> A purposive sample is the one whose characteristics are defined for a purpose that is relevant to the study.\n\n## Sample of convenience\n\nProblems:\n\n::: nonincremental\n-   \"In research, we therefore implicitly seek to generalize the findings from our sample to the entire population, present and future.\"[^2]\n:::\n\n[^2]: Andrade C (2021). The Inconvenient Truth About Convenience and Purposive Samples. Indian J Psychol Med, 43(1):86-88. Doi: 10.1177/0253717620977000\n\n::: incremental\n-   low generalizability. What is true for your sample might not reflect what is true for the population.\n-   in practice, you can only generalize findings to the subpopulation from which the sample was taken from.\n-   sometimes, a sample of convenience is the best option researchers have (e.g. studies that extract data from national healthcare or insurance databases)\n-   It is rarely possible to draw a truly random sample from the population\n:::\n\n. . .\n\nThis does not invalidate the studies in question. They can have high \"internal validity\". The issue is with generalizing, i.e, its external validity.\n\n. . .\n\n::: notes\nHowever, this is possible only if our sample is representative of the population; a sample is likely to be representative of the population only if it is randomly drawn from the population.\n:::\n\n## What about sampling error?\n\n::: goal\nSampling error: Chance deviations between estimates and the truth.\n:::\n\n. . .\n\nEven when you did NOTHING wrong.\n\n. . .\n\n. . .\n\n::: goal\nSampling error is the difference between the estimate and its true parameter value — and it can be quantified!\n:::\n\n## Sampling error\n\n-   Even if you sample perfectly, by the book, your estimates will differ from the true parameter.\n\n-   Unlike bias, it is not systematic. Rather, it is governed by chance and does not occur in a systematic direction\n\nE.g: average horn size in rhinoceros taken from two same-sized samples from the same population (unbiased samples) might (very likely) will give estimates that differ to some extent from each other but without a clear “direction”\n\n## Example of sampling error\n\nto do: use R code\n\n## Sampling error declines with sample size\n\nto do: use R code\n\n## Estimates are random variables\n\n-   Because an estimate is a random variable, the value of an estimate is influenced by chance.\n\n-   Therefore estimates will differ among random samples from the same population.\n\n![](images/clipboard-1924864965.png)\n\n::: notes\nwe're assuming here that we don't have the bias issue discussed for this example previously.\n:::\n\n## How bias and sampling error affect estimates\n\n::::::: columns\n:::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n::: r-stack\n**Sampling Bias**\n:::\n\n-   Systematic difference between estimates & parameters.\n-   Driven by bias in the sampling process (i.e., sample not random in relation to the population of interest), regarless of sample size.\n::::\n\n:::: {.column width=\"50%\\\"\"}\n::: r-stack\n**Sampling Error**\n:::\n\n-   Undirected deviation of estimates away from parameters.\n-   Driven by chance.\n-   Decreases with sample size.\n::::\n:::::::\n\n## Goals of estimation\n\n::: goal\nAccuracy (on average gets the correct answer)\n:::\n\n::: goal\nPrecision (gives a similar answer repeatedly)\n:::\n\n![Image: Wikipedia Commons (public domain).
