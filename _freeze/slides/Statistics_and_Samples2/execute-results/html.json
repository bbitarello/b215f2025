Also known as \"self-selection\" bias.\n:::\n\nFor example:\n\n-   Volunteers for sex studies are more likely to be open about sex.\n-   In surveys about sexual activity, gender biases answers in opposite directions.\n-   Volunteers for medical studies may be sicker than the general population.\n-   Animals that are caught may be slower or more docile than those that are not.\n-   The case we saw about the 1936 U.S. elections.\n\n::: notes\nAsk for volunteers to name some. The US elections example also involves sample of convenience.\n:::\n\n## Selection bias\n\n[![From: https://xkcd.com/2618/.

What is true for your sample might not reflect what is true for the population.\n-   in practice, you can only generalize findings to the subpopulation from which the sample was taken from.\n-   sometimes, a sample of convenience is the best option researchers have (e.g. studies that extract data from national healthcare or insurance databases)\n-   It is rarely possible to draw a truly random sample from the population\n:::\n\n. . .\n\nThis does not invalidate the studies in question. They can have high \"internal validity\". The issue is with generalizing, i.e, its external validity.\n\n. . .\n\n::: notes\nHowever, this is possible only if our sample is representative of the population; a sample is likely to be representative of the population only if it is randomly drawn from the population.\n:::\n\n## What about sampling error?\n\n::: goal\nSampling error: Chance deviations between estimates and the truth.\n:::\n\n. . .\n\nEven when you did NOTHING wrong.\n\n. . .\n\n. . .\n\n::: goal\nSampling error is the difference between the estimate and its true parameter value — and it can be quantified!\n:::\n\n## Example of sampling error\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Statistics_and_Samples2_files/figure-revealjs/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png){width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: aside\n\nThe iris data set gives the measurements (in cm) of the variables sepal length and width and petal length and width for 50 flowers from each of 3 species of iris.
