They will also be available in the study guide.\n:::\n\n## How do we choose random numbers? It’s actually really hard!\n\n-   Here is random number generator, where the randomness comes from atmospheric noise <https://www.random.org/integers/>\n-   In practice, for most statistical purposes, pseudo-random numbes are good enough and what we usually get with \"random sampling functions\" in R.\n\n::: aside\nOne notable example of when this may not be good enough is cryptography, but that's outside of our scope. If you're curious, you can learn more [here](https://dev.to/artis3n/random-vs-pseudorandom).\n:::\n\n## Random sampling in R\n\n::: nonincremental\n-   Actually pseudo-random\n-   If you run the code below, it is very unlikely you will get the same numbers I did\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Sample 3 random numbers between 1 and 10 1.

Setting a **seed**!\n-   If you run the code below with the same seed you should get the same numbers I did\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Sample 3 random numbers between 1 and 10 1.

We will focus a lot on this in our next topic about how to display and describe data.

It's like a celestial calling for secretarial excellence in the land of the midnight sun.\n\n::: aside\n**What is this?** \"Random correlations dredged up from silly data, turned into linear line charts.
