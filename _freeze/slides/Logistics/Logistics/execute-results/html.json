Bitarello (she/her/hers)\n-   PhD in human evolutionary genetics\n-   Professor \\@ BMC since July 2021\n-   Computational biologist/population geneticist/evolutionary biologist/statistical geneticist, etc\n-   Interested in all things related to evolution\n:::\n:::::\n\n# Our TA\n\n-   Nicole Cavalieri\n\n-   English Major/ Data Science Minor\n\n-   R rockstar!\n\n    ![](images/IMG_3542-02.jpeg)\n\n# Pre-Reqs\n\n-    No prior experience with programming is required!\n-    BIOL B110 or B111 highly recommended (though not required). **Why?** Examples are heavily focused on biology, though the concepts and skills learned will be transferable\n-   Students who have taken PSYC B205/H200 or SOCL B265 are [not]{.underline} eligible to take this course.\n-  High school algebra - if you’re not sure, I recommend checking [Khan Academy - Algebra Basics](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra-basics) for a recap\n\n\n# Logistics\n\nEverything I am about to say is in the syllabus!\n\n-   Materials\n-   Things to do/install\n-   Course structure\n-   Policies\n-   How to succeed\n\n# Materials\n\n::::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n-   Textbook: Whitlock and Schluter *The Analysis of Biological Data*, 3rd edition (2nd: ok, but check pages)\n\n![Cover of 3rd edition](images/textbook.png){width=\"271\"}\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n-   Laptop with browser for labs\n-   Scientific calculator (not graphing calculator) $\\sim\\$12$\n-   [Scientific vs Graphing Calculator](https://www.architecturelab.net/whats-the-difference-between-scientific-and-graphing-calculator/)\n:::\n:::::\n\n# Tech things to do\n\n-   Have a laptop for labs and calculator for exams\n-   Join Piazza\n-   Make accounts in DataCamp and Posit Cloud using BMC/HC email\n-   Then accept invite sent by email (check spam)\n\n# Other things to do\n\n-   Read course info document and schedule (posted on Moodle)\n-   Answer pre-course survey\n-   Check course schedule and reach out asap if there are issues\n-   Check midterm dates and plan accordingly\n\n# Course Pages\n\n-   Course website: <https://bbitarello.github.io/b215f2025/> has syllabus, schedule, etc.\n-   All assignments must be uploaded on Moodle (except DataCamp)\n-   Keys, slides, study guides will also be posted on Moodle\n-   Course website: <https://bbitarello.github.io/b215f2025/>\n\n# Course Pages\n\n-   Piazza is the preferred method for any questions that may benefit classmates, both logistical and content-related\n-   Piazza allows you to post anonymously (note: I will still know your identity)\n\n::: aside\nDatacamp and Posit Cloud will also be used weekly so join asap!\n:::\n\n# Course Structure\n\n![](images/figs.003.png)\n\n::: notes\nLectures: Statistical concepts, address questions based on readings. In-class activities will occur often and count towards participation. Lectures are designed with the assumption that you have completed the pre-assigned readings, enabling us to dive deeper into nuances, applications, and questions. Labs: R computer lab (bring your laptop) with guided tutorial. R Labs are due by the end of the day.\n:::\n\n# Formative vs Summative Assessments\n\n-   Formative assessments happen often and are focused on learning\n-   DC and R labs are gladed for completion/effort\n-   Quizzes may be taken multiple times (final grade is average)\n-   PS graded benevolently\n\n![](images/figs.005.png)\n\n# DataCamp\n\n-   Assigned weekly to practice lab skills\n-   DC shows the hard deadlines but ideally you should complete the weekly DC activities as they are assigned, weekly\n\n# Attendance and Late Work\n\n-   Please communicate need to miss class by email.\n-   Grace days: every one gets 4, no questions asked, just email a day before deadline and say how many days you need for a given assignment\n-   Late work otherwise penalyzed -10% per day\n\n# AI policy\n\nWe are following the BMC Honor Code. Please see syllabus.\n\nQuestions about this: now or later on Piazza.\n\n\n::: notes\nwho has read the syllabus? if not, read now the part on this\n:::\n\n# FAQs answered in the syllabus\n\nPlease visit the FAQ section of the syllabus. A few examples...\n\n\n1.  What if I have to miss class?\n2.  What if I cannot turn in an assignment in time?\n3.  What if I am requesting an extension because of sickness?\n4.  What if I have accommodations?\n\n\n# How to succeed\n                                                                                                                       \n-   Attendance\n-   Pre-class prep\n-   Complete all activities — be consistent and diligent\n-   Check Piazza regularly, attend office hours at least 2x\n-   Don’t leave everything for last minute — that will not work well\n-   Communicate proactively\n\n# Questions?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n",
