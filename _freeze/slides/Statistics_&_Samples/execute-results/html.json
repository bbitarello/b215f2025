Some disciplines teach you how to think with numbers and others teach you critical thinking but statistics if where you learn to put the two together and this skill is essential for life in the 21st century.” (January 12, 2021)\"}\n\n# What is statistics?\n\n![](images/statsvenn.png){fig-alt=\"venn diagram shows statistics as the intersection of critical thinking and thinking with numbers\" fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n# What is BIOstatistics?\n\n![](images/statsvenn2.png){fig-alt=\"venn diagram shows biostatistics as the intersection of critical thinking, biological data, and thinking with numbers\" fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n# Why should *you* care about statistics?\n\n-   Biology (ecology, genetics, immunology, microbiology, …)\n-   Biomedical sciences\n-   Public health\n-   Data science\n-   Economy, Psychology, Social Science\n\n# Why should *anyone* care about statistics?\n\n:::: {.columns}\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n-   Good science!\n-   Critical evaluation of “scientific evidence”\n-   Statistics and probability are not intuitive\n-   We tend to jump to conclusions and we are very often wrong\n-   Transferable skills\n:::\n\n::: column\n![This is my adorable dog, Cashew](images/cashew.jpeg){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"217\"}\n:::\n::::\n\n# Challenge: data deluge\n\n![Cover from \"The Economist\" (Feb 27-March 10, 2010)](images/datadeluge.png){fig-alt=\"Cover of the magazine “The economist”.
